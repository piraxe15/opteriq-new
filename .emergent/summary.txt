The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Opteriq website from a basic MVP to a highly dynamic, professional AI automation agency site. The initial phase focused on understanding the existing codebase, applying mandatory configurations, and then making the site more dynamic by removing repetitive elements and enhancing animations, aiming for a style similar to morningside.ai. This involved significant CSS and component-level modifications across various sections like Hero, Services, Process, FAQ, Contact, and Footer, ensuring mobile responsiveness.

Subsequent iterations addressed specific user feedback, refining icon animations from too strong to a breathing + glow effect, and meticulously fixing display issues like cut letters on titles. The engineer also integrated new content, specifically expanding the FAQ section and updating social links. The work culminated in a robust, visually appealing, and functionally enhanced frontend, with a clear understanding of backend API contracts, though the immediate focus shifted to frontend UI/UX and mobile adaptation. The process involved continuous iteration, detailed screenshot validations, and direct addressing of user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial request was to transform their existing Reddit-connected website (Opteriq) to be more dynamic and less repetitive, akin to morningside.ai. This included increasing background animations, updating translations, and ensuring mobile responsiveness.

Key requirements evolved throughout the conversation:
1.  **Dynamic Enhancements**: Increase overall site dynamism, specifically background animations across all sections, interactive micro-animations (hover effects, scale transforms, glow, smooth transitions), and particle systems.
2.  **Repetitive Element Removal**: Eliminate duplicate Call-to-Actions (CTAs), repetitive statistics (e.g., 95% successful projects), streamline card layouts, and consolidate contact forms.
3.  **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure all new features and existing elements are fully responsive and touch-friendly across various mobile devices.
4.  **Content Updates**:
    *   Change 95% successful projects to ∞ Possibilités Infinies to reflect a new business.
    *   Change 48h prototype delivered to 72h.
    *   Expand the FAQ section with new questions related to AI automation, costs, implementation, security, and results, with full translations.
    *   Update social media links in the footer to only include LinkedIn with a specific URL.
5.  **Icon Animation Refinement**:
    *   Initially, make icons (in Services, Process sections) blink and sparkle rapidly and strongly, similar to a specific style.
    *   Later, refine this to a soft and transparent animation like other subtle icons on the site (e.g.,  style).
    *   Finally, evolve this to a breathing + glow effect, similar to the ∞ Possibilities Infinies icon in the Hero section, applied to all section icons (Services, Process, Technologies, Automations).
6.  **Visual Section Separation**: Implement visible but smooth squares or rectangles to separate sections, indicating progression.
7.  **Professional Background Icons**: Integrate subtle background icons for tools like n8n, Make, Cursor, and custom code to convey professionalism and expertise.
8.  **New Sections**: Add Notre Stack Technologique (Our Tech Stack) and Automatisations Populaires (Popular Automations) sections.
9.  **Technical Fixes**: Resolve issues with letters (e.g., 'g', 'p', 'q') being cut off in titles, especially on different browsers/zoom levels. Address horizontal scrolling on mobile devices (overflow).

The product is an AI automation agency website, enhanced with modern, dynamic UI elements, professional branding, and updated content to reflect the company's offerings and early-stage status.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on resolving critical mobile adaptation issues. The user reported that the site was not well-adapted for mobile, specifically experiencing horizontal scrolling and content (like letters 'g', 'p', 'q') being cut off or disappearing off-screen, even when content was supposed to be centered.

The engineer's last actions were focused on fixing this mobile responsiveness problem. This involved:
1.  Adding  to the  and  elements in  to prevent horizontal scrolling:
    
2.  Adjusting the positioning and overflow properties of floating elements within  and  to ensure they do not cause horizontal overflow on mobile. For instance, adjusting  properties or adding .

The engineer then performed multiple  calls, specifically requesting screenshots at a  width to simulate a mobile viewport, to verify the fix. Although some tool call errors occurred due to invalid syntax in the test script, the last screenshot analysis (Chat 321) was intended to confirm the mobile fix. The user's last message keep going (Chat 322) indicates that they want the engineer to continue with the testing and ensure the mobile adaptation is perfect.

The current state of the product is that it has undergone extensive UI/UX enhancements, including dynamic breathing icons, consolidated statistics, new tech stack and popular automations sections, expanded FAQs, and a refined social media presence (LinkedIn only). The current focus is on final mobile responsiveness bug fixes after previous attempts to fix cut letters and icon animations.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue testing the mobile responsiveness across different screen sizes to confirm the  and element positioning fixes have fully resolved the horizontal scrolling issue.
